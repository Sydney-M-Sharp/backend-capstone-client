<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

-There's nothing I love more than taking a trip with my out of town friends. The only problem is the planning phase of the trip! I want to be able to plan a trip all together no matter how far away we are, suggest events, and bounce ideas off each other. Then wouldn't it be great if once we finished planning we could look in one place for all of the plans rather than swimming through texts and email to remember what the itinerary is? 
With this app I hope to do just that, welcome to my trip planning app Socii. With this app users will be able to create trips and invite others to create and share events for that trip in one convenient easy to read location. Long-term I hope to be able to implement a function allowing users to like event suggestions. This means if there are two events at the same time they can like the one they prefer to attend. 

Trips are meant to be fun so let's take away some of the stress of planning!
